## Course overview
An algorithm is a recipe for solving a problem, and solving problems is a large part of what programming is all about. Programmers do not only have good general problem-solving skills, they also rely on a large body of standard algorithms that help them get to the solution quickly.

Practical examples of the problems we will consider include:
• Shuffling a deck of cards;
• Queuing requests so they’re processed in the correct order;
• Searching through a set of data for items that match some chosen criteria;
• Finding your way out of a maze
• Diagnosing a medical condition
