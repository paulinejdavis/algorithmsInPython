## Course overview
An algorithm is a recipe for solving a problem, and solving problems is a large part of what programming is all about. Programmers do not only have good general problem-solving skills, they also rely on a large body of standard algorithms that help them get to the solution quickly.

Practical examples of the problems we will consider include:
• Shuffling a deck of cards;
• Queuing requests so they’re processed in the correct order;
• Searching through a set of data for items that match some chosen criteria;
• Finding your way out of a maze
• Diagnosing a medical condition


These are domain-specific problems but the algorithms that solve them have much wider applications. A single problem might be solved by more than one algorithm, and we will also consider how to weigh their pros and cons in order to make an informed choice between them.


This course aims to help if you already know a little Python but do not yet feel you know how to “think like a programmer”. To promote understanding and help to hone your problem-solving skills, we will often solve a problem “from scratch” rather than using, say, a built-in library function.

We therefore look at the algorithms both theoretically and practically. First, we will make sure we understand exactly what the problem is and how the algorithm works. Then you will write Python code that “implements” the algorithm. We will also consider wider and sometimes unexpected applications that your code may have.

Participants who will attend the full course will receive a City Lit certificate of attendance electronically for their CV or CPD records. The certificate will show your name, course title and dates of the course you have attended.

This is a live online course. You will need:
- Internet connection. The classes work best with Chrome.
- A computer with microphone and camera.
- Earphones/headphones/speakers.
We will contact you with joining instructions before your course starts.

## What will we cover?

• Data structures such as linked lists, queues, hashmaps and stacks
• State machines
• Algorithms for sorting and searching through data
• Approaches to pathfinding (exhaustion, flood fill, A*) and decision-making (decision trees)
• Functions, including recursive functions.

## What will I achieve?
By the end of this course you should be able to...

• Identify and work with a variety of Python data structures and use them to solve
• Use a state machine to manage a process that can respond to external events
• Write your own algorithms for sorting and searching and understand the trade-offs involved
• Write a pathfinding algorithm to solve a maze
• Use a decision tree to navigate a complex set of information.
